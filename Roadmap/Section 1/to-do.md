***FOUNDATIONS OF QUANTUM INFORMATION***

**Step 1: Visualization and Intuition (Videos)**

Before diving into the math, let's see what a Qubit looks like with animations.

**Watch (Required):** [The Map of Quantum Computing - Quantum Computing Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UlxHPIEVqA)

Why: This video offers a great "bird's-eye view" map. It summarizes the concepts of Qubit, Superposition, and Entanglement in a single video with very clear graphics.

**Watch (Alternative/Reinforcement):** [Kurzgesagt - Quantum Computers Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28)

Why: Although a very popular resource, its visualization (especially the state of qubits between 0 and 1) is the most memorable.

**Watch:** [Veritasium - How Quantum Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_IaVepNDT4)

Focus: Pay attention to the "electron spin" part in the video. This is important for understanding how qubits are physically created.

**Step 2: Mathematical Foundation**

We're connecting Linear Algebra to Quantum Mechanics.

**Watch:** [3Blue1Brown - Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g)

Task: While watching the video, note that the concept of "Eigenvalue" is actually a "measurement result." (This will be very useful later).

**Read:** Quantum Computing for Everyone (Bernhardt) - Chapter 2: Linear Algebra

Task: Get acquainted with the Bra-Ket Notation (∣v⟩) in the book. See that the vector ∣0⟩ means [10​] and the vector ∣1⟩ means [01​].

**Step 3: Initial Conceptual Deepening (Bloch Sphere)**

The most technical and accurate way to visualize qubits is the Bloch Sphere. I just want you to get acquainted with this concept for now.

Explanation: A classical bit can only be the North Pole (0) or the South Pole (1). A qubit, however, can be any point on the surface of this sphere.

**Research:** Search "Bloch Sphere animation" on Google Images or YouTube and watch for 1-2 minutes how the vector rotates on the sphere. This is important because we will be rotating the vector on this sphere later when working with "Quantum Gates".

**Step 4: Interactive Reinforcement**

**Apply:** Quantum Country - [Quantum computing for the very curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc)

Task: Read the first article ("Part 1 - The state of a qubit"). Answer the interactive questions within it. This site uses spaced repetition to help you remember what you've learned.
